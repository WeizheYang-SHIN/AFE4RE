The framework of deep learning used in this study is TensorFlow1.

run "python main_train_streamlined.py" to train a model for relation extraction based on the train set of ACE05 Chinese dataset.

run "python main_predict_streamlined.py" to predict the relation type based on the test set of ACE05 Chinese dataset.
